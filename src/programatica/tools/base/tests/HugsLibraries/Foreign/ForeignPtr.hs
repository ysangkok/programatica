newForeignPtr :: FinalizerPtr a -> Ptr a -> IO (ForeignPtr a)
-- ^Turns a plain memory reference into a foreign pointer, and
-- associates a finaliser with the reference.  The finaliser will be executed
-- after the last reference to the foreign object is dropped.  Note that there
-- is no guarantee on how soon the finaliser is executed after the last
-- reference was dropped; this depends on the details of the Haskell storage
-- manager. The only guarantee is that the finaliser runs before the program
-- terminates.

withForeignPtr :: ForeignPtr a -> (Ptr a -> IO b) -> IO b
-- ^This is a way to look at the pointer living inside a
-- foreign object.  This function takes a function which is
-- applied to that pointer. The resulting 'IO' action is then
-- executed. The foreign object is kept alive at least during
-- the whole action, even if it is not used directly
-- inside. Note that it is not safe to return the pointer from
-- the action and use it after the action completes. All uses
-- of the pointer should be inside the
-- 'withForeignPtr' bracket.  The reason for
-- this unsafety is the same as for
-- 'unsafeForeignPtrToPtr' below: the finalizer
-- may run earlier than expected, because the compiler can only
-- track usage of the 'ForeignPtr' object, not
-- a 'Ptr' object made from it.
--
-- This function is normally used for marshalling data to
-- or from the object pointed to by the
-- 'ForeignPtr', using the operations from the
-- 'Storable' class.

-- | This variant of 'newForeignPtr' adds a finalizer that expects an
-- environment in addition to the finalized pointer.  The environment
-- that will be passed to the finalizer is fixed by the second argument to
